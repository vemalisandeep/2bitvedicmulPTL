# Vedic Multiplier Design Using PTL and CMOS Logic

## Introduction
Multipliers are fundamental in digital systems, commonly used in processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), and other high-performance applications. Traditional multiplier designs face challenges in power consumption, delay, and area efficiency. Vedic Mathematics, particularly the "Urdhva Tiryagbhyam" (UT) algorithm, provides a solution by breaking complex multiplications into simpler steps, resulting in faster and more area-efficient computations.

This project presents a 2-bit Vedic multiplier using Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) to improve computational efficiency in digital systems. Compared to CMOS-based designs, PTL reduces transistor count, power dissipation, and delay, making it suitable for compact, high-speed applications like ALUs, embedded systems, and IoT devices.

## Vedic 2-Bit Multiplier
### Overview of the UT Algorithm
The Vedic "Urdhva Tiryagbhyam" (UT) algorithm divides the multiplication process into smaller, parallelizable steps, optimizing speed and area usage. For binary inputs A (A1A0) and B (B1B0), the output product terms are derived as follows:
- **S0** = A0B0
- **S1** = (A0B1) XOR (A1B0)
- **S2** = (A0A1B0B1) XOR (A1B1)
- **S3** = A1B1

### Circuit Design Using PTL
The 2-bit Vedic multiplier in this project leverages PTL, a method that minimizes transistor count, enhancing efficiency in power and area. Each logic block uses between 5 to 8 MOSFETs, optimizing for compactness and low power consumption.

### Benefits of Using PTL
PTL reduces the overall transistor count compared to CMOS, resulting in lower power usage, faster operation, and a smaller area footprint. However, PTL may experience reduced output voltage swing, which can be mitigated with proper transistor sizing.

## Vedic Multiplier in CMOS Logic
In this implementation, the Vedic multiplier is designed using traditional CMOS logic. CMOS-based multipliers perform well in terms of voltage stability but generally require a higher transistor count, leading to increased power consumption and area. Diagrams of the CMOS layout and transistor-level implementation are included for comparison.

## Vedic Multiplier in PTL Logic
The PTL design of the Vedic multiplier reduces the required transistor count by using pass transistors instead of complex CMOS gates. This results in reduced power consumption and faster computation. PTL, however, can face challenges such as lower voltage swing; by carefully adjusting transistor sizes, these effects are minimized, preserving signal integrity and ensuring stable operation.
